        Hey beautiful, I hope you know that you are the sun in my sky, the twinkle in my eye and the reason 
        my heart skips a beat every time you walk into the room.You have this way of brightening up even the
         gloomiest days, and I'm constantly in awe of your radiant personality.

        She had safe eyes, perhaps that's the best way to say it. She had a beauty that made those 
        billboard-princesses look as paper thin as they are, she was something robust and real.

         that kind of beauty, it's just there.
